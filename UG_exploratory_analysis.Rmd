**PENDING** : assess which libraries to include.

```{r, include = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	warning = FALSE,
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

The primary goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to provide a primary dataset of NYC Urban Greenspaces upon which regression analysis can be conducted with potentially associated dimensions (temperature, econometrics, and health outcomes).

Secondly, this EDA aims to provide:

* a descriptive analysis of the NYC Urban Greenspaces primary dataset;
* relevant data visualizations of the above (notably including a map using the `leaflet` package and overtime trends);
* **TBD** a test of homogeneity to assess the distribution of Urban Greenspaces (UG) at the City Council District and Borough levels.


## Data load & wrangling

The primary Urban Greenspaces (UG) dataset is loaded ("UG_df_raw"). Next, `str()` and `skmir::skim()` functions are used to delve into the contents and structure of the resulting dataframe.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
UG_df_raw = read_csv("./data/GreenRoofData2016_20180917.csv", na = c("","Unknown")) 

# Variables contained in the dataframe
str(UG_df_raw)

# Quick summary
skimr::skim(UG_df_raw)

# Looking into key variables
UG_df_raw %>%
  count(borough)

UG_df_raw %>%
  count(ownertype)
```

Additionally, a secondary dataset with the same variables aggregated by City Council Districts is loaded. Although not the main object of this EDA, it might be useful to conduct homogeneity test at such level.

```{r}
UG_agg_df= read_csv("./data/NYC_CounDist_GreenRoof_Bldg_MaxHVI_PctCSO.csv", na = c("","Unknown")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

# Variables contained in the dataframe
str(UG_agg_df)

# Quick summary
skimr::skim(UG_agg_df)
```


Next, the "UG_df_raw" is wrangled in order to:

* select relevant variables using `select()`
* rename certain variables for comprehension using `remame()`
* re-order the variables using `arrange()`

**NOTE** consider removing "bin" and "bbl" if they are not needed to match with tax-related data.

```{r}
UG_df = UG_df_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(fid:notes, address:ycoord, -doitt_id, -qa, -feat_code, -spdist1, -bbl_fixed) %>% 
  rename(
    UG_id = fid,
    latitude = ycoord,
    longitude = xcoord,
    cons_year = cnstrct_yr,
    green_area = gr_area,
    building_area = bldg_area
  ) %>% 
  select(UG_id, cons_year, borough, zonedist1, address, ownertype, longitude, latitude, green_area:groundelev, everything()) %>% 
  drop_na(green_area)
```

Note that variable name and explanations are included in the "README_1.html" file, found inside the data folder of this project.

## Descriptive analysis

```{r}
```

## Data visualization

Using the `leaflet` package to plot observations on a NY map.

Overtime trends (# of UG inaugurated per year).
