<p><strong>The Christmas trees in the urban green spaces, daytime summer
surface temperature, and heat vulnerability index New York City map
represent the urban green spaces in New York City.</strong></p>
<p>The map above shows a large percentage of urban green spaces located
in lower Manhattan, which also has one of the lowest daytime summer
surface temperatures and heat vulnerability index. In neighborhoods with
higher daytime summer surface temperatures and heat vulnerability index,
there is little to no urban green spaces. The amount of urban green
spaces present may affect the daytime summer surface temperatures and
heat vulnerability index of neighborhoods in New York City.</p>

<h4>Regression Analysis of UGS and Temperature</h4>
<p>In this section, we investigated if there is an association with
urban green space and daytime surface temperature/heat vulnerability
index. We performed univariate regression analyses to understand whether
the total number of urban green space influences either the average
daytime surface temperature or the average heat vulnerability index
score.</p>
<p>In the first univariate model, we investigated the influence total
urban green space has on the average daytime surface temperature in
NYC.</p>

<p>While this analysis did not find an association between the amount of
urban green spaces present and daytime surface temperature or the amount
of urban green spaces present and heat vulnerability index, we believe
this can be caused by weaknesses in the data available to us. More
specifically:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The temperature dataset and the primary dataset are not collected
from the same location. It may be interesting to explore the association
of green space are and temperature predictors from data that were
collected at the same coordinate. This may give a better understanding
of the impact of green space area and at risk neighborhoods.</p></li>
<li><p>The datasets vary in the date of collection. Unlike the UGS data,
the daytime surface temperature data was collected on a single day and
the heat vulnerability index data was collected across a few
years.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, we believe it is important to keep exploring the impact
on urban green spaces, especially as a means to fight climate
change!</p>

<h1>Comparison of Asthma Rates with UGS</h1>
<p>Next we will compare the UGS dataset with the asthma dataset, first
visually and then also based on linear models.</p>
<p>We load and wrangle the <strong>two primary Urban Green Spaces (UGS)
dataset</strong> to generate a <strong><code>UG_df</code>
dataframe</strong>, as well as the <strong>asthma dataset</strong> to
generate a <strong>asthma_df</strong> dataframe, as described in the
respective pages dedicated to the exploratory analysis of the
datasets.</p>
<p>Next, we create a value of green spaces that we can compare to asthma
rates, namely the cumulative surface area of vertical greenspace that
has been constructed between 2006-2018 in each borough.</p>

<h4>Visualizations on UGS &amp; Asthma Rates</h4>
<p>We first visualize the result and compare it to the graph created on
ED visits (taking that as a proxy for asthma rates). One trend is clear:
while asthma rates seem to have declined, there seems to have been an
increase in UGS. The patterns are not consistent across borough, e.g.,
there has been only gradual improvement in UGS in the Bronx, while the
decline in asthma was more drastic. In short, there must surely be many
other factors at play that have caused asthma rates to decline, but
potentially UGS did play an effect in reducing the numbers.</p>

<h4>Regression Analysis of UGS and Asthma Rates</h4>
<p>Let’s run a couple of linear regression to see whether they produce
any statistically significant results.</p>
<p>First, we are creating a combined df consisting of both UGS and
asthma datasets by using a (double) leftjoin based on borough and year.
We are using na.locf() to replace missing UGS values with the value from
the last year (i.e, if there was a year with no greenspaces added, then
that year must have had the same total number of greenspaces as the last
year). Due to the way the dataframe is structured this requires a manual
insertion of a value at two points of the dataset.</p>
<p>Let’s run some regression! First I am creating separate dataframes
for each indicator and set Manhattan as the comparator.</p>
<p>Below tables show the results of linear regression of the indicator
(either ED visit rate, Hospitalization rate or severity measure) on a
combination of borough and total UGS surface area.</p>

<p>To our surprise, all three models return statistically significant
values for the effect of cumulative UGS surface area on the studied
indicators, while accounting for borough differences. The direction of
the effect is how we would expect: increase in cumulative UGS surface
area leads to a reduction in ED visit rate, hospitalization rate, and
our severity measure! We conclude that urban green spaces might indeed
have played a role in reducing asthma rates across New York City.</p>

<h1>Comparison of Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) with UGS</h1>
<p>When trying to find some association between greenspace data and
average EITC tax credit amount, it’s not possible to draw statistical
conclusions with the information we have. The data were collected with
different methods and it would be wrong to do statistical comparisons.
That being said, we can create visualizations that give an overall idea
of trends.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is that there will be more rooftop greenspaces present
in boroughs where the average EITC credit amount is lower.</p>
<p>To create this visualizations, we have to make a few assumptions.</p>
<p>The <code>Greenspace</code> data does not specify when rooftop
greenspaces were constructed. We know that the data was collected
between 2016-2018 and have information on when the building was
constructed but that’s all the detail we’re given. Meanwhile, EITC tax
data for all EITC categories is accounted for from 2006 onward.</p>
<p>We are going to assume that buildings constructed from 2006 onward
were constructed initially with their rooftop greenspace. Given the cost
of construction and the logistics involved with residential building in
New York City, we’re assuming that developers did not retroactively add
greenspace after initial construction of these modern buildings.</p>
<p>We’re also going to eliminate Staten Island from this visualization.
Staten Island doesn’t have enough data on Greenspace to make it
reasonable to include in a visualization.</p>

<p>The visualization shows what we initially thought: Manhattan rooftop
greenspace cumulative area has rapidly increased in the time frame while
their average EITC credit amount has stayed the lowest of all the
boroughs. Meanwhile, the Bronx has consistently had the highest EITC
credit amount while having a very low rate of increase in rooftop
greenspace.</p>
<p>Again, this is correlation, not causation but it does speak to the
idea that rooftop greenspaces tend to appear in wealthier areas.</p>

<p>The full regression model above uses ETIC, borough and cumulative
green area as predictors of ED visits per 10,000 inhabitants. The model
shows statistically significant results for two boroughs: Bronx and
Queens. This is an effect we have already observed in univariate
analysis of the asthma data set. Unsurprisingly, the model did not yield
statistically significant results for the effects of cumulative green
space and tax on asthma rates. However, the direction of the effect is
as expected: the model does show lower asthma rates for higher
cumulative greenspace. This effect was not statistically significant,
however, the p value of 0.098 is moderately strong. What is unexpected
is the effect of tax on asthma rates: asthma rates decreases as EITC
increases in this model. We would have expected the opposite
relationship, however the effect in this model was not statistically
significant, with a p-value of 0.91.</p>
<p>As already discussed, this was a hypothetical public health model
that could have been applied in the real world. Because of the
limitations of our data (we had to make do with what we could source
online) as well as the fact that asthma is a multifactorial diseases
(meaning many factors contribute to it’s development), this isn’t a
perfect representation of the real world.</p>
<p>This project, however, has given us the opportunity to apply the
tools and theories that we’ve learned this semester and that are very
relevant to cutting-edge research within the public health world.</p>
