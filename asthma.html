<div id="asthma-rates" class="section level1" align="center">
<h1><span style="color: red;">Asthma Rates</span></h1>
</div>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>Asthma is a disease that causes breathing problems. It inflames and
narrows the airways that carry oxygen in and out of the lungs. People
with asthma can have recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness,
shortness of breath and coughing. These breathing problems are called
asthma attacks or episodes. Asthma is a chronic disease. In other words,
people with asthma live with it every day. Asthma is triggered by an
allergic reaction between the lungs and allergens in the environment
including air pollution, diesel exhaust particles, tobacco smoke,
cockroach particles, dander, and mold (Columbia Center for Children’s
Environmental Health, 2022). Heightened asthma rates are one of the
negative health outcomes resulting from high population density of
cities (and resulting high density of environmental toxins being
released into the atmosphere).</p>
<p>Asthma is a serious public health problem in New York State and the
nation. It affects about 10.0 percent (more than 400,000) of children
and 9.9 percent (more than 1.5 million) of adults in New York State.
Asthma takes its’ toll in many ways. It can result in lost nights of
sleep and disruption of activities for the individual, as well as for
his or her family. Asthma is the leading cause of school absenteeism in
children, and parents frequently miss days from work as a result of
their child’s asthma. The burden of asthma falls disproportionately on
the most disadvantaged residents of New York City. A study has reported
that children in East Harlem are 13 times more likely to go to the
emergency room for asthma-related incidents compared to children in the
nearby affluent Upper East side. The inequality is reflected by the 31%
of East Harlem residents living in poverty compared to 7% in the Upper
East Side. Racial demographics mirror this pattern, with East Harlem
being half Latino and one third Black compared to the 78% White Upper
East Side (LóPez et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Could roofs planted with vegetation, aka. <strong>Urban Green Spaces
(UGS)</strong>, help reduce the burden of asthma? At least in theory,
plants absorb gaseous pollutants that are in the air. By absorbing
harmful gases, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere which could
help to combat the harmful effects of air pollution. Our hypothesis is
that by having green spaces in urbanized areas, such as rooftop
vegetation, a higher quality of the air within the surrounding area
could be achieved.</p>
<p>In the following analysis, we will be drawing on a dataset of asthma
hospitalizations and ED visits between 2000 and 2019 in New York State,
broken down by regions. Asthma ED visits and hospitalization rates tell
us about the effect of asthma in a community due to environmental and
household triggers, access to medical care, and the quality of disease
management for asthma. ED visits and hospitalization shows us only the
most severe cases of asthma; most people with asthma suffer the health
effects without needing to go to hospital.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<div id="goals-of-the-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Goals of the analysis</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this analysis is to provide an overview of asthma
rates across the different boroughs of NYC. We would like to understand
how the asthma burden of asthma is distributed across the different
borough, as well as analyse whether there have been any changes over
time.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
</div>
<div id="data-load-wrangling" class="section level2">
<h2>Data load &amp; wrangling</h2>
<p>We load and wrangle the <strong>secondary NY Asthma dataset</strong>
to generate a <strong>asthma_df dataframe</strong>. The original .csv
dataset is available in the “data” folder within the project’s
repository. The following procedure is applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>filter for relevant observations (aka the boroughs of New York City
from years 2006-2018) using <code>filter()</code></li>
<li>select relevant variables using <code>select()</code></li>
<li>rename certain variables for comprehension using
<code>remame()</code>, as well as certain borough names and years using
<code>mutate()</code>and <code>recode</code>()`</li>
<li>re-order the variables using <code>arrange()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, we created a second asthma dataframe with the goal of having
<strong>severity measure</strong>, which we defined as the number of ED
visits divided by the number of Hospitalizations (both per 10k
inhabitants), for each borough and year separately. We achieved this by
leveraging the use of <code>pivot_wider()</code>, <code>mutate()</code>
(i.e., calculating the new measure) and <code>pivot_longer()</code>.</p>
<p>Note that all variable names are available in the <strong>Project’s
code book</strong> section.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
</div>
<div id="descriptive-analysis-visualization" class="section level2">
<h2>Descriptive Analysis &amp; Visualization</h2>
<p>Next, we perform a descriptive analysis of the NY Asthma secondary
dataset, as well as stratified analysis at the borough level. Overall,
the *<strong>asthma_df</strong> contains contains 6 variables related to
156 measures of asthma in NYC.</p>
<div id="developments-on-new-york-city-level" class="section level4">
<h4>Developments on New York City Level</h4>
<p>Below graph shows the development of ED visits per 10k inhabitants
between 2006-2018 across all of New York City. Rates increased until
2013 to a peak of close to 160 recorded ED visits per 10k inhabitants,
after which a stark drop has been recorded, a trend that seems to
continue to this day. In 2018 recorded ED visits per 10k inhabitants
were down to close to 110 per 10k inhabitants.</p>
<p><img src="asthma_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Next, we look a graph that shows the development of Hospitalizations
per 10k inhabitants between 2006 and 2018 across all of New York City.
After remaining stable at approx. 35 per 10k inhabitants, the rate
started to drop continuously and has reached less than half of that
value of approx. 15 per 10k inhabitants. On first glance, it seems as if
hospitalizations have decreased more than ED visits, indicating that
while both rates and severity of asthma have dropped, severity has
declined more.</p>
<p><img src="asthma_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>To test this we next plotted the severity measure we calculated
manually in the previous section: the rate of Hospitalizations per 10k
inhabitants divided by the rate of ED Visits per 10k inhabitants. We
conclude that our above hypothesis seemed to have been correct: in 2006
roughly every fourth (or approx. 24%) of ED visits resulted in
Hospitalizations, that number has gradually decreased to every
seventh-eight (or approx 13%). We hereby assumed that every
Hospitalizations had a prior ED visit.</p>

<h4>Developments on Borough Level - Static</h4>
<p>Below table shows ED visits and Hospitalizations per 10k inhabitants
for each borough, and for New York City overall as averages across
2006-2018. The Bronx is a clear outlier, with 264 / 10k ED visits and 56
/10k Hospitalizations, compared to the city average of 143 / 10k ED
visits and 28 / 10k ED visits. Manhattan is slightly above the average,
while Brooklyn is slightly below. Queens and Staten Island are below the
average. In summary, the burden of asthma historically clearly does not
seem to be distributed evenly across the different borough of New York
City.</p>

<p>Let’s look at whether these inequalities persisted in the most recent
measurement. Below table shows ED visits and Hospitalizations per 10k
inhabitants for each borough, and for New York City overall in 2018.
Asthma rates across all boroughs have decreased. While Bronx rates went
down to 221 / 10k and 34 / 10k ED visits resp. Hospitalizations, the New
York City average lowered to 116 / 10k and 15 / 10k ED visits resp.
Hospitalizations. In conclusion, the inequities observed across the
different boroughs seem to have persisted.</p>

<p>The following graph visualizes above: ED visits / 10k inhabitants by
borough in 2018. the Bronx is particularly hit with high asthma rates,
even as of today.</p>
<p><img src="asthma_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>A very similar pattern is observed for hospitalizations rates / 10k
inhabitants by borough in 2018. The unequal burden is even more
accentuated, as the Bronx tops the list by a wide margin. The Bronx not
only seems to be affected more by higher asthma rates, the asthma cases
also seem to be more severe (relatively) to the other boroughs.</p>
<p><img src="asthma_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Before we move to to visualizations over time, we wanted to take a
look at absolute burden across the different boroughs. The following
table shows the total number of ED Visits and Hospitalizations per
borough (i.e., not adjusted per 10k inhabitants) in 2018. The Bronx tops
the list with 95k ED visits, followed by Brooklyn with 82k - compared to
the total number in NYC of 279k this means that those two boroughs make
up roughly two thirds of all asthma related ED visits. The same holds
true for hospitalizations, where Bronx recorded 14k and Brooklyn 10k in
2018 (compared to 37k across NYC).</p>

<p>The following graphic visualized what was discussed above, at the
example of absolute number of ED Visits in 2018. The Bronx and Brooklyn
are clearly carrying the largest burden of asthma ED visits in New York
City.</p>

<div id="developments-on-borough-level---over-time"
class="section level4">
<h4>Developments on Borough Level - Over Time</h4>
<p>This section is the most critical one, as we analyze how rates have
changed over time.</p>
<p>Below graph visualizes ED visits / 10k inhabitants per borough from
2006 to 2018. The patterns over time are relatively consistent: the
Bronx has always been the most affected borough, and Queens / Staten
Island always the least, while Manhattan and Brooklyn were always close
to the city average. The Bronx experienced much more fluctuation in
rates, a decrease from 2006-2010 was followed by an increase until 2014
and a subsequent stark decline until 2018. All borough seem to
experience sinking ED visit rates over between 2014-2018.</p>
<p><img src="asthma_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Below graph visualizes Hospitalizations / 10k inhabitants per borough
from 2006 to 2018. The general pattern is different to ED visits, as
nearly all boroughs experienced a consistent decline in Hospitalization
rates since 2006. The Bronx tops the list across all years, while all
other borough have gotten pretty close to the city average.</p>
<p><img src="asthma_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Lastly, we look at severity of asthma in the boroughs across time by
using our measure of hospitalizations divided by ED visits.
Interestingly, this is the one measure where the Bronx (while still
remaining among the highest on the list) has managed to close the gap to
the other borough. Still, in the Bronx about 15% of ED visits lead to
hospitalizations, while that number only 10% in Manhattan.</p>

<h2>Regression Analyses</h2>
<p>Next, we will be analyzing whether linear models can provide further
insights into asthma rates across NYC’s boroughs.</p>
<p>First step is to create three dataframes (one for each indicator)
that do not include New York City overall and set Manhattan as the
comparator borough.</p>
<p>Running a linear regression for ED visits, all values are
significant: the Bronx is predicted to have 112 / 10k ED visits more
vs. Manhattan, while Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten island are predicted
to have 16 / 10k, 67 / 10k resp. 69 / 10k less than Manhattan.</p>

<p>Running a linear regression for Hospitalizations, all values except
for Brooklyn and Queens are significant: the Bronx and Brooklyn are
predicted to have 33 / 10k resp.3 / 10k hospitalizations more
vs. Manhattan, while Queens and Staten Island are predicted to have
approx 6 / 10k each less than Manhattan.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This exploratory analysis has made evident the inequalities that
continue to persist across NYC’s boroughs in terms of asthma rates. It
has shown that asthma rates in generally are improving, but that still a
lot of work needs to be done, especially in the Bronx, who continues to
carry the largest asthma burden. These results were confirmed to be
statistically significant, with regression models being run on a per
borough level for ED Visist / 10k inhabitants, Hospitalizations / 10k
inhabitants, as well as a manually calculated severity measure.
Secondly, we would like to understand whether there might be any links
between the UGS dataset and the asthma dataset. For example, did
increases in the primary dataset on NYC Urban Green Spaces also
correlate with a simultaneous decrease in asthma rates?</p>
