Final Group Project
================

# Group Project Proposal

1.  Group Members:

    - Meritxell Mallafré Larrosa (mm5951) — GH: mm5951
    - Tim Hauser (th2899) - GH: thausel
    - Emma Warshaw (ew2718) - GH: EmmaWarshaw
    - Niklas Hess (nh2706) – GH: hessniklas
    - Esther Kim (ei2262) - GH: ei2262

2.  Tentative project title:

    - “The effects of urban green spaces on asthma, and its association
      with economic and temperature metrics”

3.  Motivation for this project:

    - Roofs planted with vegetation — known as green roofs — can help
      cities adapt to a changing climate by absorbing storm water,
      lowering local temperatures, and providing insulation that cuts
      indoor heating and cooling costs. Yet green roofs cover less than
      0.1% of New York City’s 1 million buildings, according to a new
      analysis.

4.  Intended final products:

    - Website including a landing page (maps visualizing the primary
      dataset) and separate sub-pages including correlates with:
      - Health outcomes
      - Economic metrics
      - Environmental temperature

5.  The anticipated data sources:

    - Primary dataset: [Green Roofs Footprints for New York
      City](https://zenodo.org/record/1469674#.Y20dRuzMJ_T)
    - Asthma in NYC: [Department of
      Health](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/Hyperlocal-Temperature-Monitoring/qdq3-9eqn/data)
    - Temperature in NYC: [City of New
      York](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/Hyperlocal-Temperature-Monitoring/qdq3-9eqn/data)
    - Income in NYC: [Earned Income Tax Credit Claims in New York
      City](https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Earned-Income-Tax-Credit-EITC-Claims-by-Credit-Typ/6q7b-8vuf)

6.  Planned analyses:

    - We are using green spaces (GS) as the main dataset, which will be
      combined that with other datasets for further analyses:
      - Economic: how correlated vertical GS are with income
      - Temperature: how vertical GS can reduce heat island
      - Health: how vertical GS can reduce Asthma rates

7.  Planned timeline:

    - November 12 = Submit final group proposal
    - November 17 = Have project review meeting
    - December 10 =
      - Submit written report giving detailed project description
      - Submit webpage overview of project, with short expanatory video,
        which will be published online (platform: tbd)
      - Submit peer assessment (short document that contains a brief
        assessment of each team member’s contribution)
    - December 15 = participate in the “in-class” discussion of projects
