<h1><span style="color: red;">Welcome to our Final Project</span></h1>
</div>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>This website is constructed as the final deliverable for the
<strong><em>P8105 final project</em></strong>. Before jumping into the
actual analysis, four main topics need to be explained.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Our Team</strong> and how we each contribute</li>
<li><strong>Key Motivations</strong> and <strong>Related Work</strong>
that will show the intention behind this project</li>
<li><strong>Research Questions</strong> of this projects</li>
<li><strong>The Data</strong> that is used throughout the project</li>
</ol>
<p>The outcome of our work is something we are very excited about and
hope will be the starting point of more research. Additionally, like
every good public health professional, it is our goal to support
positive change - the findings of this project provide initial insights
that individuals, organizations, and governments can directly act
upon.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<div id="our-team" class="section level2" align="center">
<h2>Our Team</h2>
</div>
<p>The beauty of a final project within this format is the ability to
present important information beyond the data outputs. Since a groups
work is based on individuals and their own lived experiences, we want to
take this opportunity to present our team to you. With 5 members and 5
unique perspectives on this project, please feel free to click <a
href="about.html"><strong>HERE</strong></a> to find out more.</p>

<div id="motivation" class="section level2" align="center">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Location Matters:</strong> Anyone active in Public Health
will know that location is one of the most important determinants of
health. One of the key examples of this is redlining - referring to a
discriminatory US practice that saw predominantly black neighborhoods
being disadvantaged by withholding loans, public spending, and more.
While redlining as a “known” practice might be an atrocity of the past,
the underlying importance of ones living location continues to matter A
LOT. Just think about implicit biases, access to education,
environmental factors, and density of healthcare providers. As such, it
was very clear to this group that our project needed to incorporate some
type of location factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public Health is EVERYTHING:</strong> One of the most
influential lectures for this group at Mailman was with Professor
Merlin. He started by describing what Public Health really meant. Just
healthcare? Gun violence? Income distribution? Access to work? Clean
water? The correct answer was: <u><em>ALL OF THE ABOVE</em></u></p>
<p>Public Health is a unique field, as it is broad beyond most peoples
imagination - everything ones sees in ones daily life is connected to
Public Health in one way or another. As such, it was important to this
group to touch upon a number of different factors while working on this
project. To us, only by considering a number of factors, could we do
justice to Professor Merlin and the education we have received at
Mailman.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Systems Thinking:</strong> Of course, when considering a
number of different Public Health factors, some key challenges arise.
Most importantly, “how do those factors interact with one another?”</p>
<p>Within Public Health, this question is tackled by systems thinking.
Simply put, your access to education influences your access to work,
which in turn influences your income and investments within your
community, which ultimately influence your neighborhoods access to
education.</p>
<p>For this group, applying systems thinking meant looking beyond
individual analysis, but combining all data-sets to understand how green
spaces, income, health, and temperature could all influence one another.
The findings are fascinating and can be found <em>here</em>.</p></li>

<div id="related-work" class="section level2" align="center">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
</div>
<p>This project was inspired by the <a
href="https://ecologyandsociety.org/vol27/iss3/art20/">data set</a> from
Examining the distribution of green roofs in New York City through a
lens of social, ecological, and technological filters. This study
examined the presence of rooftop greenspaces in New York City, noting
that although about 20% of NYC landscape is covered in buildings,
rooftop greenspace is only detected in a small fraction of those areas.
We were interested in comparing rooftop greenspace to additional
variables that can give a better overall understanding of the social
determinants of health in the five boroughs.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<div id="research-questions" class="section level2" align="center">
<h2>Research Questions</h2>
</div>
<p>Our initial goal was to understand how rooftop urban green space
correlated with 3 other predictors individually: asthma rates,
temperature data, and earned income tax credit (EITC) amounts in each
borough. We originally hoped to use temperature, asthma rates, and EITC
as predictors of cumulative green space area, stratified by borough.</p>
<p>However, as we progressed through the project, we began to rethink
our outcome variable for the overall model. Since we’re interested in
public health outcomes, we decided to use asthma as the outcome variable
in a full regression model. Because of data limitations and a univariate
comparison between our temperature data and greenspace proved to not be
significant, we excluded temperature from the overall model.</p>
<div align="center">
<p><img src="images/UGS_diagram.jpg" style="width:100%"/></p>
</div>
<p>Manipulating these data sets taught some valuable lessons, namely how
much effort goes into data collection and wrangling. It also showed us
that studying the social determinants of health is extremely
challenging. We were able to piece together data sets that showed us the
individual elements we wanted to model, but the reality is that it would
be better if all of these factors were coming from a single unified,
health-systems informed study. That being said, we were still able to
find meaningful insight with what we had to work with.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level2" align="center">
<h2>The Data</h2>
</div>
<p>The project at its core is based on four main data-sets. Each of them
is geographically based in New York City, and we managed to combine all
of them through a location variable that specifies the NYC neighborhood.
To understand how exactly they interact with one another, let’s jump
into each:</p>
<div id="urban-greenspace" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="UGS.html">Urban Greenspace</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Roofs planted with vegetation — <strong>Urban Green Spaces
(UGS)</strong> — can help cities adapt to a changing climate by
absorbing storm water, lowering local temperatures, and providing
insulation that cuts indoor heating and cooling costs. Using <strong>a
publicly available dataset</strong>, which includes data from n=736 UGS
as of 2016, we conduct a secondary analysis to draw links to economical,
clinical and environmental factors that could potentially be associated
with the distribution of UGS within New York City (NYC).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tax-credits" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="tax_data.html">Tax Credits</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>One way to get a general understanding of socioeconomic status of a
geographic area is to look at Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) data, as
it is designed to give a tax credit to low-to-moderate income workers
and families. Using this data, we aim to understand the financial status
of residents in each borough and explore its relationship with urban
design, clinical and environmental factors.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="temperature" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="temp.html">Temperature</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Temperature Analysis</em> explores the daytime surface
temperature and heat vulnerability index scores of the 5 boroughs in
NYC. Neighborhoods with higher surface temperatures tend to have more
heat-exacerbated deaths associated with extreme heat events. The daytime
surface temperature shows which neighborhood is more at-risk due to
higher surface temperatures. The heat vulnerability index further
expands on the notion that hotter neighborhoods are more at-risk of heat
illness and death. Based on a number of social and environmental
factors, the heat vulnerability index is scored on a 5-point scale (1
being lowest at-risk and 5 being highest at-risk). Both the daytime
surface temperature and heat vulnerability index provide a better
understanding of which neighborhood is most at-risk of heat illness and
heat-exacerbated deaths.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="asthma" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="asthma.html">Asthma</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Heightened asthma rates are one of the negative health outcomes
resulting from high population density of cities (and resulting high
density of environmental toxins being released into the atmosphere). We
sourced data from the New York State Department of Health website,
showing the number and rate of asthma hospitalizations and emergency
department (ED) visits in New York State by age groups, sex, year, and
total population. Through the data, we aim to understand how the asthma
burden of asthma is distributed across the different borough, as well as
analyse whether there have been any changes over time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="joint-analysis-dashboard" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="analysis.html">Joint Analysis Dashboard</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly, we aim to explore the relationship between the
four aforementioned data-sets, applying systems thinking to our
analysis. In doing so, we first establish individual relationships
(greenspace and temperature, asthma and greenspaces, etc.) and
ultimately construct one large regression model with all significant
factors included. It is important to note that the final model faces
several limitations, which will be explored in detail.</li>
</ul>
