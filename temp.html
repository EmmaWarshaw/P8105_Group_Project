<div id="temperature" class="section level1" align="center">
<h1><span style="color: red;">Temperature</span></h1>
</div>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>Temperature varies by borough in NYC due to the amount of green space
and buildings present in each borough. Boroughs with less green space
are more likely to have higher temperatures than boroughs with more
green space. Asphalt pavements absorb and store more heat than natural
surfaces, such as those covered by green spaces. Neighborhoods with
higher temperatures also have more heat-exacerbated deaths associated
with extreme heat events.</p>
<p>This analysis includes datasets that were retrieved from <a
href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-explorer/climate/?id=2141#display=summary">Climate
Datasets</a>. This dataset is publicly available by NYC.gov. The
datasets used are “Daytime Summer Surface Temperatures (°F)” and “Heat
Vulnerability Index (NTA)”. Neighborhood tabulation areas (NTA) codes
were used to merge the two datasets for 188 neighborhoods in New York
City. NTAs are neighborhoods that were created by the NYC Department of
Planning by aggregating census tracts into 195 neighborhood-like areas.
Some neighborhoods were combined to reach the minimum population of
15,000 per NTA.</p>
<p>

<div id="goals-of-the-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Goals of the analysis</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this analysis is to explore the daytime summer
surface temperature and heat vulnerability index scores of neighborhoods
across New York City. A dataset that contains both daytime summer
surface temperature and heat vulnerability index scores (“envo_health”)
was used.</p>
<p>Secondly, this analysis aims to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>a descriptive analysis of the daytime summer surface temperature and
heat vulnerability index scores in New York, as well as stratified
analysis at the Borough levels</li>
<li>relevant data visualization of the above (notably a map using the
leaflet package)</li>
<li>an attempt to fit the dataset into a linear regression model to
elucidate differences in the daytime summer surface temperatures and
heat vulnerability index scores at the Borough levels</li>
</ul>
<p>
 
</p>
</div>
<div id="data-load-wrangling" class="section level2">
<h2>Data load &amp; wrangling</h2>
<p>To create the <code>envo_health</code> dataset, we merged the daytime
summer surface temperature dataset and heat vulnerability index dataset
by NTA codes. The longitude and latitude coordinates for each
neighborhood was manually added to the dataset. Some of the coordinates
did not match exactly with the neighborhoods because multiple
neighborhoods were combined when the NTA codes were created. The borough
for each neighborhood was also manually matched to create the variable,
<code>borough</code>.</p>
<p>The heat vulnerability index data were collected from 188
neighborhoods across the 5 boroughs of NYC and represent the
community-level heat impacts due to extreme heat events. A statistical
model using social and environmental factors, such as surface
temperature, green space, air conditioning access, poverty, and Black
population, was used to estimate the risk of heat-related death and
develop the 5-point index score scale, with 1 being the lowest risk and
5 being the highest risk. The Black population was specifically included
in the model because it identified as the most excluded from heat
resources. Residents who are at highest heat risk also did not have or
use air conditioning, were older or had chronic health conditions or
serious mental illnesses.</p>
<p>The daytime summer surface temperature data were collected in
Fahrenheit and varied based on vegetative covering and materials that
retain heat, such as paved roads, sidewalks, and buildings. In this
analysis, the daytime summer surface temperature was re-coded to
represent temperature in Celsius. The neighborhoods were identified by
NTA codes to match the neighborhoods captured in the heat vulnerability
index dataset.</p>
<p>The <code>envo_greenroof</code> dataset, which is used in the
<em>Joint Analysis</em> contains the total green urban space, in square
meters, the average daytime summer surface temperature, the average heat
vulnerability index score, and boroughs. This dataset was created to
investigate the influence urban green space has on the average daytime
summer surface temperature and on the average heat vulnerability index
score in NYC.</p>

<p><em>Note: Score ranges from 1 (lowest risk) to 5 (highest risk), with
low vulnerability at no risk of heat illness and death.</em></p>
<p>In Table 2, there does not seem to much variability in the mean
daytime summer temperature across the 5 boroughs. Bronx has the highest
mean heat vulnerability score (4.086), making it the borough with the
high risk of heat illness and death. Staten Island has the lowest mean
heat vulnerability score (1.526), with residents having little to no
risk of heat illness and death. Bronx is known to have a large Black
population and a larger proportion of individuals with lower income.</p>

<h2>Regression Analyses</h2>
<p>To investigate if the differences in daytime summer surface
temperature and heat vulnerability index were significant across
boroughs, two univariate linear models were built to explore the
association between:</p>
<ul>
<li>boroughs and daytime summer surface temperature</li>
<li>boroughs and heat vulnerability index</li>
</ul>
<p>Univariate models were because only one predictor was used. Linear
models were used because the outcome variable,
<code>daytime_surface_temp</code>, was continuous.</p>
<div id="daytime-summer-surface-temperature-and-borough"
class="section level4">
<h4>Daytime Summer Surface Temperature and Borough</h4>
<p>In the first univariate model, we investigated the influence of
boroughs on daytime summer surface temperature in NYC. The descriptive
analyses showed that the mean daytime summer surface temperature was not
appreciably different across boroughs. A linear model was created to
further explore if there was an association between borough and daytime
summer surface temperature.</p>

<p>The linear model shows that there is a significant difference in
daytime summer surface temperature comparing Queens to Manhattan
(reference group). This may explain why the daytime summer surface
temperatures in Manhattan are lower than those in Queens. There may be
multiple factors that contribute to this, such as the amount of urban
green space.</p>

<h4>Heat Vulnerability Index and Borough</h4>
<p>In the second univariate model, we investigated the influence of
boroughs on the heat vulnerability index in NYC. The descriptive

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, throughout this exploratory analysis, plotting, and
regression modeling attempts of n=188 Daytime Summer Surface Temperature
and Heat Vulnerability Index Dataset (“envo_health) as of 2018, we
conclude:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall, within New York City, the average daytime surface
temperature is 36.92°C and the average heat vulnerability index score in
NYC is 3.</li>
<li>The average daytime summer surface temperature is not appreciably
different across the 5 boroughs, but the heat vulnerability index scores
vary. The Bronx has the highest at-risk score of heat-related illness
and heat-exacerbated deaths. Staten Island has the lowest at-risk score
of heat-related illness and heat-exacerbated deaths.</li>
<li>The differences in daytime summer surface temperatures are
significant between Queens and Manhattan (reference group). The
differences in heat vulnerability index scores are significant between
Bronx and Manhattan, Brooklyn and Manhattan, and Staten Island and
Manhattan. These significant differences may be influenced by multiple
factors, including the amount of urban green space available to bring
down the daytime surface temperature and lower the heat vulnerability
index score.</li>
<li>There are limitations to the temperature analyses performed. The
daytime surface temperature dataset was collected on a single-day in
July (July 17, 2018), which may not be an accurate representation of the
daytime summer surface temperature. This may have created a false
association seen in the univariate linear regression model investigating
the influence of borough on daytime summer surface temperature. A
dataset that has collected daytime summer surface temperature each day
of summer in 2018 may have been a more accurate representation. The heat
vulnerability index dataset was collected from multiple data sources. It
is not clear how each social and economic predictor was collected and
coded, which may affect the true association of borough and heat
vulnerability index. Moving forward, we recommend that daytime summer
surface temperature and heat vulnerability index scores are collected
similarly, with data on comparable social and economic predictors. This
would allow a more accurate representation of the differences and
influences of each borough in New York City and further assist the New
York City department in creating policies that benefit the most
vulnerable populations in New York City.</li>
